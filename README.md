# A simple program to extract a palette from a picture. 

Image manipulation in Golang.

The task to extract a color palette from a picture is always arbitrary, and the current approach is to: blur -> resize -> cluster.

Might use the Colormind API (http://colormind.io/) to refine the results.

Ongoing.
